The FTW Onchain Clans feature includes two primary competitive systems: the Clans System and the Nations System. Both systems are currently being designed with a focus on intense team-based competition and fast, global distribution of rewards via crypto.

## Clans System

The Clans System is being designed to promote strategic team play, allowing players to join forces and compete for significant rewards. Only clans created by holders can register for these competitions, reinforcing the exclusive nature of clan participation.

### Key Features

Clans Leaderboard
- Clans compete for leaderboard positions, with scores based on the total points accumulated by members.
- Each clan can have up to 30 active players, encouraging strategic collaboration.
- Only clans formed by holders are eligible to register for clan competitions, ensuring that participation aligns with community investment.
- Rewards, including NFTs and tokens, are distributed automatically based on the clan’s final leaderboard position.
- Clan owners can customize how rewards are divided among members, setting specific cuts to motivate stronger contributions.

Competitive Dynamics
- Tournaments occur on weekends, with players accumulating points that contribute to the clan’s rank.
- The system supports competitive collaboration, as players work together to maximize their clan’s performance and rewards.

## Nations System

The Nations System enables players to represent one of two global factions, each led by the two largest holders of the Genesis NFT.

### Key Features

Nations Leaderboard
- Players represent one of the two nations, with leaderboard rankings determined by the total points accumulated by each nation.
- Ownership of the nations is automatically assigned to the two largest holders of the Genesis NFT, further tying leadership to community standing.
- The system uses a “winner-takes-all” model, where the winning nation claims the prize pool, distributed proportionally to the most active players.
- Rewards are based on individual contributions, encouraging continuous engagement and rewarding top performers.
	
Buffs and Incentives:
- To maintain a balanced competition, the losing nation receives buffs for the next tournament, encouraging a dynamic and strategic competitive environment.

Both the Clans System and the Nations System are currently in the design phase, with the goal of delivering a high-risk, high-reward experience and swift, global reward distribution via crypto.
