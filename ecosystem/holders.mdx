### 1. Yield

### **A) Staking For Points ($JUICE)**

Holders can stake their Jungle Genesis NFTs within the platform to accumulate points for future $JUICE rewards. These points will act as a representation of the holder’s participation and long-term commitment to the ecosystem. Over time, these points can be converted into **$JUICE**, the future native token of the Jungle ecosystem, offering an additional layer of economic yield beyond immediate gameplay rewards.

`Points = (Assets Staked) x (Days Staked) x (Multiplier)`

The staking mechanism rewards long-term commitment. The longer a holder stakes their NFT, the more points they accrue, leading to higher potential $JUICE payouts over time. This creates a sustainable incentive for holders to remain engaged with the Jungle ecosystem.

**Tiered Multipliers**: Holders who possess multiple Genesis NFTs will receive higher points multipliers when they stake. This rewards those who acquire and stake more assets, amplifying their points accumulation and staking returns.

- **1 Asset (JUICERO)**: 1X multiplier
- 3 Assets (JUICETTO):
- **5 Assets (JUICELOT)**: 2X multiplier
- 7 Assets (JUICETON):
- **10+ Assets (JUICETRON)**: 3X multiplier

**Ranking Based on Total Staked Points**: Stakers are ranked based on the total number of points they’ve accumulated through staking Genesis NFTs. The points leaderboard offers a highly visible status indicator that aligns with +EV holder behavior—showcasing the most committed and invested users.

### **B) Prize Pools and Wagering Systems**

One of the core value propositions of the Genesis NFTs is the potential for active yield generation through competitive gameplay and betting. The prize pools and wagering systems ensure that members benefit directly from active participation and asset ownership.

- **(Members Only) Tournaments with Prize Pools:** Holders will gain access to exclusive tournaments with real money prize pools. These tournaments are designed to distribute value back to the community, providing a tangible return on investment for competitive players.
- **Wagering and Speculation:** The Jungle ecosystem incorporates a robust wagering mechanism, where players can bet on their own performance, outcomes of matches, or on the performance of others. This creates a **poker economy**, where value is exchanged directly between players, making every match a potential yield event for players.
- **Zero-Sum Economy:** The Jungle ecosystem is designed to operate within a zero-sum framework, ensuring that the yield generated within the platform is derived from active participation and risk-taking, rather than inflationary token models.

### 2. **Social**

Holding a Jungle Genesis NFT not only provides gameplay and financial incentives but also reinforces the social dynamics within the community. This membership model is built on the principles of **fun, competition, and social belonging**, providing benefits such as:

**A) Membership Club** 

The experience is modeled after a VIP poker club, where members can bet, compete, and socialize within a closed-loop zero sum economy. Holders are encouraged to form alliances, clans, and social structures to compete for dominance.

**Access to Wagering Events:** Holders can engage in high-stakes betting events exclusive to NFT holders. These events cater to the intersection of the **'killer' and 'gambler' archetypes**, allowing players to experience a speculative, high-intensity environment akin to an **onchain fight club**.

**B) Clan Ownership**

The biggest whales within the ecosystem are given the right to be nation (special clans) owners, who will manage a group of top players in special community events and competitions. These individuals will serve as community leaders, helping to recruit the best players to compete against other clans in game.
