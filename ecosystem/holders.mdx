## **Economic Model and Value Drivers**

The economic model for the Genesis revolves around three core drivers that appeal to the primary motivations of our holders:

- **Making Money:** The wagering system, real-money tournaments, and zero sum economy provide the potential for direct financial returns based on skill, performance, and gamified speculation.
- **Having Fun:** The essence of Jungle is built around fun and risk. The combination of competitive gaming, wagering, and social interaction offers a deeply engaging and highly entertaining experience for participants.
- **Belonging to a Community:** Holders will gain prestige and social status within the community, belonging to a VIP group of players and speculators. This aspect of community building helps solidify long-term engagement and loyalty within the ecosystem.
