Fruits is the second NFT collection from Jungle.

These assets are designed to be the reward layer for using the second collection (Animals) on the onchain game. The supply is elastic based on the demand.

The whole collection should be burned by the end of the season, rewarding users with tokens based on the amount of fruits they hold and the rarity (fruits with more rarity yield more tokens upon being burned).
