We are embarking on creating an ecosystem with a clear focus on user co-ownership and engagement. Our initiative aims to democratize the gaming experience by providing users with a stake in the ecosystem's development and success. This approach is rooted in our belief in the transformative potential of web3 to enhance user agency and create a more inclusive and participatory digital environment.

Jungle's ecosystem is composed by the core pillars:
- Mobile Games
- Gamified Community
- Crypto Incentives
- Onchain Fun

Our ecosystem profile system connects different accounts from different platforms into one, allowing users to view their balances, histories and other relevant information consolidated in just one place.

The objective of the system is to allow participants to earn points through different activities on different platforms but which are counted as a single score to be evaluated throughout the seasons on the leaderboards to be rewarded according to their positions.

The Jungle ecosystem's main reward distribution mechanism is seasons.
Each season, participants who reach the best positions on the season's points leaderboard receive prizes, including Juice.
