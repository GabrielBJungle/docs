We are creating an ecosystem with a clear focus on community incentive alignment. Our initiatives aims to provide a gamified experience where users have economic upside in the ecosystem's development and success. This is primarily composed by three core pillars:

* Mobile Games
* Gamified Community
* Crypto Incentives

Our ecosystem profile system connects different accounts from different platforms into one, allowing users to view their balances, histories and other relevant information consolidated in just one place.

The objective of the system is to allow participants to earn points through different activities on different platforms but which are counted as a single score to be evaluated throughout the seasons on the leaderboards to be rewarded according to their positions.

The Jungle ecosystem's main reward distribution mechanism is seasons. Each season, participants who reach the best positions on the season's points leaderboard receive prizes, including Juice.
