Guilds are the main group effort and reward mechanism of the Jungle ecosystem.
In total, there are only x10 guilds in the entire ecosystem.
The owners of the 10 guilds are always the 10 holders who have the largest amount of NFT Genesis staked at the same time.
If the holder loses position, the entire leader order changes from top to bottom.
Guilds have an exclusive vault.
Guilds score on an exclusive guild leaderboard and rewards acquired by the guild are always distributed to the guild vault.
