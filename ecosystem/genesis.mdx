The Jungle Genesis NFTs serve as the cornerstone of the Jungle gaming ecosystem, granting exclusive access and privileges to holders. These NFTs are collectibles designed to deliver value for holders through the membership club, including yield through staking, higher tier prize pools and early access features such as wagering. This document outlines the key aspects of Jungle Genesis NFTs, focusing on their utility, yield, and the benefits of the membership model.

The economic model for the Genesis revolves around three core drivers that appeal to the primary motivations of our holders:

- **Making Money:** The wagering system, real-money tournaments, and zero sum economy provide the potential for direct financial returns based on skill, performance, and gamified speculation.
- **Having Fun:** The essence of Jungle is built around fun and risk. The combination of competitive gaming, wagering, and social interaction offers a deeply engaging and highly entertaining experience for participants.
- **Belonging to a Community:** Holders will gain prestige and social status within the community, belonging to a VIP group of players and speculators. This aspect of community building helps solidify long-term engagement and loyalty within the ecosystem.
