### We like adrenaline.

We are a team driven by the thrill of taking risks, embracing the uncertainty, and thriving in the high-stakes moments that define our game, FTW. Much like poker players or those who wager for the adrenaline of the game, we find excitement in the balance between high risk and high reward. But more than just the wager, we revel in the skill it takes to navigate these moments—where every choice can turn the tide, and the right decision at the right time makes all the difference.

In our office, this same energy fuels us. We’re passionate about games that challenge both chance and skill, where the outcome isn’t just luck but how well you play your hand. Whether it’s playing a round of poker or strategizing a complex game, we live in the intersection of chance and mastery, and we bring that same philosophy into everything we create.

As a company, we believe a community can operate the same way—individuals coming together to compete and win, not just for themselves, but for something greater. Our players, united by the same hunger for victory, form clans, working together to achieve a collective win. At our core, we see ourselves as one of these clans—a group of risk-takers, strategists, and competitors who push each other to go further, who thrive on the adrenaline of shared challenges and victories. Together, we play to win.
