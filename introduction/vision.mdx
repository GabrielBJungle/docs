## Not only about Jungle
We're building the Jungle ecosystem and yet we don't stop speculating in memecoins, flipping NFTs, playing P2E games and participating in other communities. Everything we build is based on our vision as users and not just as builders, and that's why we know how important it is to create experiences that fit into the daily life of the trader, the speculator, the degen, the gamer or whatever, your style, but that consistently bring adrenaline and onchain fun.
## Not only about mobile games
We do not follow the P2E games standard. For The Win and other mobile games are just another component of the ecosystem. We want to create true on-chain fun through different games. To this end, in addition to FTW, Jungle is building its own on-chain playground.
## Games first
We are creating impactful experiences through games that are, above all, fun, and we don't limit ourselves to the standard definition of games as the world knows them today. Each piece of the ecosystem has its own gamification, ways to participate and receive value back while having fun. We are building games for mobile but also games on Discord, in the browser, on the price-chart. Everything is a game.
## Crypto rewards
In each game and ecosystem component there is a crypto incentive layer. We want each participant to be rewarded for their participation and contribution, whatever it may be. Different types of users can perform different types of activities that they consider fun and be rewarded through cryptos, becoming co-owners of the ecosystem.
## Community
The Jungle community is made up of users who share the same quest for adrenaline, and we are building a living ecosystem that evolves together with the community and shares victories. In all of Jungle's initiatives, we consider the question: "How can the community play together and win together?" Through gamified mechanisms, we are creating an environment that each participant can contribute in their own way and win together with other participants. Above all, a community with aligned incentives pursues the same goals, playing together and winning together. This goes beyond having a Discord server. It's much more about sharing experiences, victories, defeats, lifestyle, learning and whatever else we have in common.
