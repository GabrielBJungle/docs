We're building a new web3 gaming ecosystem to deliver a player-driven zero sum economy built on gamified speculation.&#x20;

In FTW, speculation is gamified through wagering and tournaments that deliver real money rewards to players.&#x20;

This model elevates the stakes of gameplay through financialization - adding risk/reward as core components of the web3 product experience.&#x20;

In this framework, blockchain technology is key to enable the payment processing and reward distribution for our players globally at scale with high speed and low cost.

This allows us to supercharge the game with a sustainable financial incentive layer that expands the user funnel and deepens player engagement.&#x20;
