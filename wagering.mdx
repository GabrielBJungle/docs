FTW Wagering is a zero-sum, skill-based system that will allow players to wager on their own matches. This upcoming feature will provide a unique and competitive way for players to put their skills to the test and potentially earn rewards based on their performance in real-time gameplay.

## Wagering Verticals

In the future, players will be able to choose from different wagering verticals that reflect specific match conditions. You’ll be able to place wagers not just on winning, but on how well you perform, adding an extra layer of strategy and excitement to each match.

Planned verticals include:

	•	Win the match
	•	Win the match with a high KDR
	•	Win without dying
	•	Win with a significant number of kills

These conditions will allow players to tailor their wagers according to their own level of confidence and skill.

## Staking as Membership

Players who stake FTW tokens will have exclusive benefits, including early access to the wagering system and special bonuses tied to their stakes. This staking model will reward our most committed community members, offering them added value and enhanced rewards when wagering.
