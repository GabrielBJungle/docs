The FTW Custom Lobby system will be a powerful feature designed to seamlessly connect players within and outside the game, allowing them to create custom lobbies, issue challenges, and manage match participation through integrated notifications.

What the Feature Enables:

**- Custom Lobby Creation**: Players will be able to set up their own lobbies, inviting friends or other players to join them for competitive matches. This allows for tailored match setups and enhances community engagement.
**- Challenge Functionality**: The feature will enable players to issue direct challenges to individuals or clans, increasing the level of competition. Once a challenge is set, it will be publicly posted, encouraging others to spectate or join in the competition.
**- Integrated Notifications**: Through integration with platforms like Discord, the system will notify players when a lobby is created or when they are challenged to a match. These notifications help keep players informed and engaged, even when they are not actively in the game.
**- Synchronization**: Players will need to sync their game accounts with external platforms to participate fully in the challenge and lobby features. This ensures smooth communication across systems and keeps the competitive ecosystem unified.
**- Real-Time Match Updates**: Once players join a match, the system will update all relevant participants about the number of players in the lobby and the countdown to the match start, providing clarity and coordination before the game begins.

This feature will enhance the FTW ecosystem by fostering competitive play and social engagement, creating a seamless experience for players to challenge each other, join lobbies, and stay connected through external notifications.
